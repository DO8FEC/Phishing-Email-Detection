# Phishing Email Detection Using Machine Learning 📧🔐

### Project Overview 🔭
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect phishing emails based on text analysis. The goal is to preprocess email text data, apply classification algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in identifying phishing emails. 

The analysis includes:
- Text preprocessing using **TF-IDF** vectorization.
- Training machine learning models to classify phishing and legitimate emails.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and feature importance.

### Dataset 📊
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle: Phishing Emails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails/data). It contains a collection of email texts labeled as either **Phishing** or **Legitimate** (Ham). The dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
